Program I made in 8th grade for locating missing persons in disaster situations. Made with python, html, and SQL. Designed for the lighttpd web server.

I made this project so long ago, I wouldn't even know how to create an instance of it off the top of my head. I highly recommend using Sahana Eden (http://eden.sahanafoundation.org) instead of trying to figure out how this old thing works.
