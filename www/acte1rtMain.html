<h1><p>Hope Board Project (Main Information Page)</p></h1>
<body>
<P>The goal of Hopeboard is to provide a means to track survivors, missing and found, after a disaster, as well as letting survivors notify others of their own well-being. 
Hopeboard accomplishes this goal by using a database to allow people to report if others are missing or found, or to report your own welfare.
Hopefully, this will make finding loved ones easier for friends and family members of disaster victims, saving time, resources, and most importantly, peace of mind. </p><br /><p>I got the idea for HopeBoard during the 2011 Alabama Tornadoes, in which Family overseas could not contact me, and worried if we were okay.
If we had Hopeboard, they could know our condition, or report that we are missing otherwise.</p>
